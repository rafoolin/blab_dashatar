# blab_dashatar

It must be confessed that I tried out different Dashatars by playing with attributes, and I wanted to know what Dashatar will be created. :D

As a result of that, this project has been made. This application lets you retrieve all dashatars by `filtering` them. It is also possible to make a `favorite list` out of them and `download` the desired image for future use.

This project is for [#30DaysOfFlutter][twitterhashtag].

You can download it on the release section.

## Getting Started

Take the project and unzip it, remove `-master` at the end of the directory and then go into the folder.

In order to run the project, you need to first install packages.

```bash
flutter packages get
```

Then run the project.

```bash
flutter run
```

# Credits

A minimalist icon variation and a dashatar icon have been created, I have set the minimal one as the default icon, you can try either one.

Images of the other icon and the original graphic asset are located in `graphics` directory. They were made using awesome [gravit-designer](designer.gravit.io).

I `do NOT require` attribution for your use/modification/etc of my gravit/icons files.
